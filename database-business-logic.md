# Database Business Logic Documentation

## Purpose
This document explains the business reasoning behind the database relationships and design decisions in the sneaker store application.

## Core Business Models

### 1. Multi-Vendor Marketplace Model

**Business Logic**: The platform operates as a marketplace where multiple vendors can sell sneakers.

**Key Relationships**:
- `users.vendor_id → users.id` (Self-referential vendor hierarchy)
- `products.vendor_id → users.id` (Vendor ownership of products)
- `users.is_vendor = true` (Vendor flag)

**Why This Design**:
- Vendors are users with elevated permissions
- Supports vendor hierarchies (distributors → retailers)
- Commission tracking via `vendor_commission_rate`
- Vendor analytics stored in JSONB for flexibility

### 2. Product Catalog with Variants

**Business Logic**: Products have multiple variants (sizes, colors) with independent pricing and inventory.

**Key Relationships**:
- `product_variants.product_id → products.id` (One product, many variants)
- `product_inventory.variant_id → product_variants.id` (Variant-specific inventory)
- `cart_items.product_variant_id → product_variants.id` (Specific variant selection)

**Why This Design**:
- Different sizes have different prices and availability
- Size conversions (US, EU, UK) handled at variant level
- Independent stock tracking per variant
- Pricing flexibility with `price_adjustment` per variant

### 3. Dual Product Structure (Products + Sneakers)

**Business Logic**: Supports both general products and specialized sneaker data.

**Tables**:
- `products` (General e-commerce structure)
- `sneakers` (Sneaker-specific fields)
- `sneaker_products_view` (Combined view)

**Why This Design**:
- Legacy system compatibility (`sneakers` table)
- Specialized sneaker fields (style_code, gtin, release_date)
- Future expansion to non-sneaker products
- Maintains data integrity while supporting specialized features

### 4. Customer Journey & Order Processing

**Business Logic**: Complete customer lifecycle from browsing to post-purchase support.

**Flow Relationships**:
```
USER → CART_ITEMS → STOCK_RESERVATIONS → ORDER_ITEMS → REVIEWS
     → SAVED_ITEMS → WISHLISTS
     → SUPPORT_TICKETS
```

**Why This Design**:
- Temporary stock holds during checkout (`stock_reservations`)
- Guest checkout support (`guest_checkouts`)
- Complete order audit trail (`order_status_history`)
- Post-purchase engagement (reviews, support)

### 5. Inventory Management Strategy

**Business Logic**: Multi-level inventory tracking with automated alerts and reservations.

**Key Components**:
- `product_inventory` (Current stock levels)
- `stock_movements` (All inventory changes)
- `stock_reservations` (Temporary holds)
- `stock_alerts` (Vendor notifications)

**Why This Design**:
- Prevents overselling with reservations
- Complete audit trail of inventory changes
- Vendor-specific alerts for their products
- Supports both product and variant level tracking

### 6. Review & Trust System

**Business Logic**: Verified purchase reviews with community validation and moderation.

**Key Relationships**:
- `reviews.order_id → orders.id` (Verified purchase requirement)
- `reviews.user_id → users.id` (Authenticated reviewers)
- `review_helpful_votes` (Community validation)
- `review_moderation_log` (Content moderation)

**Why This Design**:
- Only verified purchasers can review
- Community-driven quality through helpful votes
- Moderation tools for content management
- Photo support for visual evidence

### 7. Customer Support System

**Business Logic**: Multi-channel support with context-aware assistance.

**Key Relationships**:
- `support_tickets.order_id → orders.id` (Order-specific issues)
- `support_tickets.product_id → products.id` (Product-specific issues)
- `chat_sessions` + `chat_messages` (Real-time support)
- `automated_responses` (AI/bot support)

**Why This Design**:
- Context-aware support (order/product specific)
- Multiple communication channels
- Agent assignment and escalation
- Automated first-level response capability

### 8. Loyalty & Rewards Program

**Business Logic**: Tiered loyalty system with flexible rewards and point accumulation.

**Key Components**:
- `loyalty_programs` (Program definitions)
- `loyalty_tiers` (Tier benefits and requirements)
- `loyalty_transactions` (Point earning/spending)
- `user_loyalty_points` (Current balances and tier status)

**Why This Design**:
- Multiple concurrent loyalty programs
- Flexible tier structures
- Order-linked point earning
- Comprehensive transaction history

### 9. Sustainability Features

**Business Logic**: Environmental impact tracking and circular economy features.

**Key Relationships**:
- `environmental_impact.product_id → products.id` (Carbon footprint)
- `product_eco_certifications` (Certification tracking)
- `recycling_programs` + `user_recycling_enrollments` (Circular economy)
- `packaging_options` + `user_packaging_preferences` (Sustainable packaging)

**Why This Design**:
- Consumer demand for sustainability information
- Brand differentiation through eco-certifications
- Circular economy support (take-back programs)
- Customizable sustainable packaging options

### 10. Personalization & Recommendations

**Business Logic**: AI-driven personalization based on user behavior and preferences.

**Key Components**:
- `user_behavior` (Interaction tracking)
- `user_product_affinity` (Preference learning)
- `recommendation_cache` (Performance optimization)
- `recommendation_analytics` (System performance)

**Why This Design**:
- Behavioral learning for better recommendations
- Cached recommendations for performance
- A/B testing support through analytics
- Privacy-compliant preference tracking

## Security & Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
- User data compartmentalization
- Minimal necessary data collection
- JSONB fields for flexible, evolving requirements

### Financial Compliance
- Complete order audit trails
- Commission tracking for tax purposes
- Payment status separation from order status

### Inventory Accuracy
- Stock reservations prevent overselling
- Complete movement audit trail
- Automated low-stock alerts

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Caching Strategy
- `recommendation_cache` for expensive ML calculations
- Views for common complex queries (`sneaker_products_view`)
- JSONB for flexible, fast lookups

### Indexing Strategy
- UUID primary keys for distributed systems
- Full-text search vectors on products
- Optimized foreign key relationships

### Scalability Considerations
- Vendor-specific data partitioning possible
- Separate read/write optimized structures
- Microservice-friendly entity boundaries

## Business Rules Enforcement

### Data Integrity Rules
1. Orders must have valid customer (registered or guest)
2. Reviews require verified purchases
3. Stock reservations automatically expire
4. Vendor commission rates are mandatory for vendor users

### Business Process Rules
1. Order status progression is tracked and auditable
2. Inventory movements are logged with responsible user
3. Support tickets maintain complete conversation history
4. Loyalty points earned are tied to specific orders

### Authorization Rules
1. Vendors can only modify their own products
2. Customers can only access their own orders and data
3. Admins have full access with audit logging
4. Support agents have context-specific access

## Integration Points

### External System Integration
- Payment gateways (order payment status)
- Shipping carriers (tracking integration)
- Authentication providers (user identity)
- Analytics platforms (behavioral data export)

### API Design Implications
- RESTful endpoints align with entity relationships
- GraphQL support through relationship traversal
- Real-time updates via order/inventory status changes
- Bulk operations support for vendor management

## Future Expansion Considerations

### Marketplace Growth
- Multi-category support (beyond sneakers)
- International vendor onboarding
- Currency and localization support
- Advanced vendor analytics

### Technology Evolution
- Machine learning model storage (JSONB flexibility)
- Blockchain integration for authenticity
- AR/VR product visualization
- IoT integration for smart inventory management

This business logic documentation provides the foundation for understanding why the database is structured as it is and how it supports the complex requirements of a modern e-commerce marketplace specializing in sneakers.
